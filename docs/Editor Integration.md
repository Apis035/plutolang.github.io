Although Pluto can theoretically be used with Lua-based tooling, we provide specialised support for it to enhance your coding experience in VS Code, Sublime Text, etc. via [our Syntax Highlighting package](https://github.com/PlutoLang/Syntax-Highlighting), which provides:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Snippets — e.g. for when you type "fun" and press tab
- Comment Information — for editor features such as "Toggle Comment", "Toggle Block Comment"
- Indentation Rules — for editor features such as "Reindent Lines"
- Build Systems — currently Sublime Text only: when you press Ctrl+B, you can choose "Lint Pluto" or "Run Pltuo"
