# Tooling
Although Pluto can theoretically be used with Lua-based tooling, there is specialised support for it to enhance your coding experience in VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.

## Syntax Highlighting

There is a TextMate-based grammar for Pluto [available here](https://github.com/PlutoLang/Syntax-Highlighting). This can be used for syntax highlighting in many applications.

## Linting

A linter tells you warnings and errors without running your code. This is built into plutoc, and can be leveraged via [pluto-language-server](https://github.com/PlutoLang/pluto-language-server) to deliver the diagnostics right into your text editor.
